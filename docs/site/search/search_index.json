With recent advances in artificial neural networks, ANNs are are shown to be excellent in image recognition and translation tasks.

In this project, we aim to implement a wide range of models, both from structural and non-structural, to forecast various economic indicators, including unemployment and foreign exchange rates. Methodology Artificial neural networks, typically recurrent neural networks, are inherently suitable for capturing the inter-temporal dependency of sequential data. Also, special types of recurrent units like Long Short Term Memory Unit are designed to grasp relevant information across various lengths of lagged periods. We use historical observations as the input feed to our neural nets and use the immediately following observation as the target. I.
