# Artificial Neural Networks in Economic Forecasting (ANNEF)

## About This Project

ANNEF is a project about the intermixing of economics, computer science and statistics.

The aim of this project is to implement various time-series prediction models in python. 

And then we apply those models on economic data and compare their efficiency and accuracy on real world data.
