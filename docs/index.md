# Artificial Neural Networks in Economic Forecasting (ANNEF)

## About this Project

ANNEF is a project about the intermixing of economics, computer science, and statistics.

This project aims to implement various time-series prediction models in python.

And then we apply those models to economic data and compare their efficiency and accuracy on real-world data.


## Packages Used in this Project
This project is a learn-by-doing project, and we used various libraries to implement our models.

### Package Requirements

#### Python

* All python codes and Jupyter notebooks are written in python 3.

* Basic python packages including `numpy`,  `scipy` and `pandas` are required.
* Statistical packages including `sklearn` and `statsmodels` .
* Machine learning libraries including `tensorflow` and `keras`.

#### Matlab

* Matlab models were developed in `MATLAB_2018a` . Please note that certain machine learning packages might not be supported in earlier versions of Matlab.
