# Economic Forecasting w/ Artificial Neural Networks (EFANN)

## What's this

EFANN is a project about the intermixing of economics, computer science and statistics.

The aim of this project is to implement various time-series prediction models in python. And then we apply those models on economic data and compare their efficiency and accuracy on real world data.
