# Artificial Neural Networks in Economic Forecasting

## About this Project

ANNEF is a project focusing on the interdisciplinary areas of economics, computer science, and statistics.

With recent advances in artificial neural networks, ANNs are are shown to be excellent in image recognition and translation tasks. But we found relatively rare work done on examining the power of artificial neural networks on time series tasks.

In this project, we aim to implement a wide range of models, both from structural and non-structural, to forecast various economic indicators, including unemployment and foreign exchange rates.
